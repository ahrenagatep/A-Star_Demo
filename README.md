# A* Pathfinding Demonstration
A Java-based project that demonstrates the A* search algorithm for pathfinding in a grid-based environment. The A* algorithm is a widely used pathfinding algorithm in artificial intelligence and robotics for finding the shortest path between two points on a graph. This project provides a visual representation of the A* algorithm's execution, allowing users to observe how the algorithm efficiently navigates through obstacles to find the most optimal path.

# Features
* Visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm in action.
* Step-by-step updating of the grid to display the algorithm's exploration process.
* Calculation of the shortest path between the start and end points using the A* algorithm.

# How to use:
* Press enter to see each step of the algorithm solve the problem
* That's literally it, press enter
